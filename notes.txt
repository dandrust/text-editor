Bugs:
=====
- Put Edit mode keyhandlers in EditController
- Work out a way to make commandBuffer act as a text model and present through the status bar


Long term:
==========
- Scrolling (Make the editor buffer lines reference a section of the underlying text buffer and update appropriately)
- Word wrapping (Decouple the idea of a text line from a single editor buffer console line, adjust scrolling window accordingly)
- Highlighting
- Copy/paste
- Tab
- Numbers pane (Line numbers!)
- Status on the bottom
- Save (Includes knowing when the editor is dirty and giving exit confirmation for unsaved buffer)
