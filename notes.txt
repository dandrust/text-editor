Bugs:
=====
x Insert adds characters to the beginning of the buffer, not the end
- Code in KeyPressHandler.HandleInsert, .HandleBackspace, .HandleEnter is kind of messy
x Code from Program.HandleEnter and Program.HandleBackspace needs to be moved to KeyPressHandler
x Pressing enter should start a new line
